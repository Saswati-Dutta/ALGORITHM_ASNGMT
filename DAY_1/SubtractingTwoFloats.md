### Algorithm Steps

1.  **Start** program execution.
2.  **Declare** three floating-point variables: $a$, $b$, and $difference$.
3.  **Display** a prompt to the user: "Enter the value of a: ".
4.  **Input** (Read) the floating-point value from the user and store it in $a$.
5.  **Display** a prompt to the user: "Enter the value of b: ".
6.  **Input** (Read) the floating-point value from the user and store it in $b$.
7.  **Process/Calculate**: Compute the difference: $difference = a - b$.
8.  **Display** the result: "Difference = [value of difference]".
9.  **Return** the integer value $0$, and **End** the program.
