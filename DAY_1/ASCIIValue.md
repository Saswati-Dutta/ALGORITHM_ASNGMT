### Algorithm Steps

1.  **Start** program execution.
2.  **Declare** a character variable, $c$.
3.  **Display** a prompt to the user: "Enter a character: ".
4.  **Input** (Read) the character from the user and store it in $c$.
5.  **Process/Output**: Display the string "ASCII value of [character] = [integer value]". (The program automatically converts the character variable $c$ to its integer ASCII value when printed with the `%d` format specifier).
6.  **Return** the integer value $0$, and **End** the program.
