### Algorithm Steps

1.  **Start** program execution.
2.  **Declare** an integer variable: $year$.
3.  **Input**: Read and store the value for $year$ from the user.
4.  **Decision 1**: Check if $year$ is perfectly divisible by 400 ($year \% 400 == 0$).
    a.  **IF Yes**: Output "$year$ is a Leap Year".
    b.  **IF No**: Proceed to Decision 2.
5.  **Decision 2**: Check if $year$ is perfectly divisible by 100 ($year \% 100 == 0$).
    a.  **IF Yes**: Output "$year$ is NOT a Leap Year".
    b.  **IF No**: Proceed to Decision 3.
6.  **Decision 3**: Check if $year$ is perfectly divisible by 4 ($year \% 4 == 0$).
    a.  **IF Yes**: Output "$year$ is a Leap Year".
    b.  **IF No**: Output "$year$ is NOT a Leap Year".
7.  **End** the program.
